INGREDIENTS

    1/2 teaspoon dried whole lime powder
    1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
    2 tbsp all-purpose flour
    1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
    1 onion, finely chopped
    1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
    1/2 teaspoon saffron
    1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces
    1/4  teaspoon ground white pepper
    1 pinch ground cumin    
    1 pinch ground coriander
    3â€‰1/4 cups hot water
    1 cube chicken bouillon
    1/4 cup tomato puree

DIRECTIONS
 First Step 
    Mix together the saffron, cardamom, cinnamon, allspice, white pepper, and lime powder  
    in a small bowl, and set the spice mix aside.

 Second Step 
    Melt the butter in a large stock pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in the  
    garlic and  onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, 
    about 5 minutes. Add the chicken pieces and brown them over medium-high heat until 
    lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Mix in the tomato puree.

 Third Step 
    Stir in the canned tomatoes with their juice, the grated carrots, whole cloves, 
    nutmeg, cumin, coriander, salt, black pepper, and the Kabsa spice mix. Cook for about 
    3 minutes; pour in the water, and add the chicken bouillon cube.

 Fourth Step
    Bring the sauce to a boil, then reduce the heat to simmer and cover the pot. Simmer 
    until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes.

 Fifth Step 
    Gently stir in the rice. Cover the pot and simmer until rice is tender and almost dry, 
    about 25 minutes; add the raisins and a little more hot water, if necessary. Cover and 
    cook for an additional 5 to 10 minutes or until the rice grains are separate.
